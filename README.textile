h1. Gitty : Unobtrusively extend git.

Gitty provides an interface to manage commonly used git-hooks for repositories. A few use cases are:

* Make it so that git submodules are intellegently updated after switching branches or merging.
* Prevent trailing whitespace from being committed.
* Help prevent scratch / debug code from being committed by refusing to commit a KEYWORD that marks it as such.
* Share hooks with collaborators

h2. Currently in alpha!

Missing features:

* Only receive hooks from trusted publishers. (currently when gitty is activated on a repository, any hook published to origin is automatically installed)
* It's very young and might break
